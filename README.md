# ITBC_REST_API_PROJECT
Final project in IT Bootcamp school, part II, API&amp;Postman

- URL to project: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/13464015/TVene8GT

- For purpose of testing, I used basic API REST skeleton written on JavaScript, created by Daniel Avellaneda in order 
to help other developers create a basic REST API in an easy way with Node.js.
